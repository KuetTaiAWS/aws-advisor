## How to contribute

*Before you send us a pull request, please be sure that:*

1. You're working from the latest source on the master branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently closed, pull requests to be sure that 
   someone else hasn't already addressed the problem.
3. You create an issue before working on a contribution that will take a significant 
   amount of your time.

*Creating a Pull Request*

1. Fork the repository.
2. In your fork, make your change in a branch that's based on this repo's master branch.
3. Commit the change to your fork, using a clear and descriptive commit message.
4. Create a pull request, answering any questions in the pull request form.

For contributions that will take a significant amount of time, open a new issue to pitch 
your idea before you get started. Explain the problem and describe the content you want to 
see added to the documentation. Let us know if you'll write it yourself or if you'd like us 
to help. We'll discuss your proposal with you and let you know whether we're likely to 
accept it.
